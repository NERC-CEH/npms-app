    <h3>Searching for species</h3>
    <p>
      For quicker searching of the taxa you can use different shortcuts.
      For example, to find <i>Linum catharticum</i> you can type in the search bar:
      <br>
      <br><i>lin cat</i>
      <br><i>l cat</i>
      <br><i>l .cum</i>
      <br><br>Note: searches can also be made using common names.

    <h3>Upload to NPMS</h3>
    <p>
      All your saved records will be shown on the home page.
      By default a record is in <i>draft</i> mode until it is set for submission.
      While it is in <i>draft</i> mode the application will not upload your
      record to the database. To set it for uploading,
      open the record and press the <span class="icon icon-send"></span> button in the header.
      The application will try to submit your record once there is a good network
      connection.

      If the record has reached the database a red
      <span class="icon icon-send" style="color: red;"></span>(set for submission & saved locally)
      will become blue <span class="icon icon-send" style="color: #3c479d;"></span>
      (uploaded to the database). Once it has successfully reached
      the database the record becomes unavailable for new edits.
      To further edit it
      please use the <a href="http://www.npms.org.uk">NPMS Website</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Note:</b> you have to be signed in to your NPMS account and have a network connection,
      for the records to be automatically uploaded in the background.
